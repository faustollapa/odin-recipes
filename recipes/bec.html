            This is what New York City is known for when it comes to food, excluding pizza. The bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich
            is what pretty much put New York City on the map, in terms of food. Also, BEC (bacon, egg, and cheese) is what also led
            to the popularity of chop cheese. Back in the day, BEC was the most popular dish among New Yorkers and still is but not as
            much as before. It is very affordable in deli/bodegas around the city and it is also easy to make at home.

         <h3> Ingredients </h3>
         <ul>
            <li> Bread: Roll or hero </li>
            <li> Oil, any is fine </li>
            <li> Eggs, number depending on roll or hero</li>
            <li> Bacon, several strips depending on roll or hero </li>
            <li> Cheese slices, perferably American </li>
            <li> Seasoning, such as salt, pepper, and/or paprika </li>
            <li> Optional: Any sauce such as ketchup, mayonnaise, and/or BBQ sauce </li>
         </ul>
         <h3> Steps </h3>
         <ol>
            <li> First, you would start the oven and place the pan on it. You wouldn't need oil since bacon has its own oils which help it cook. </li>
            <li> Place the bacon strips on the pan and let it cook for around 4 - 5 minutes. Then, flip it to its other side and repeat. </li>
            <li> Set the bacon aside once crisp enough. This part is optional but to cook the egg, the oil from the bacon can be used to cook the egg or you can put in oil. 
                 Crack an amount of eggs on the pan once the oil is hot. Using a spatula or whichever cooking utencil you scramble the eggs together for 4 - 5 minutes while
                 putting in seasoning to give the eggs flavor. 
            </li>
            <li> Then, place several slices of cheese depending on how many eggs you've put in. It'll cook fast on top of the eggs where it will melt on top of the eggs. </li>
            <li> Optional: If you like you bread toasted, then you can toast your bread with a bit of oil on the pan. </li>
            <li> Finally, you would place it altogether in a sandwich, in whichever order of your choice. After that, enjoy but don't forget your bev. </li>
         </ol>
